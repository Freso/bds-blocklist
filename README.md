# BDS Blocklist

This is an attempt at codifying the international calls for boycott,
divestment, and sanctions (BDS) of so-called “Israel” for use with
various blocking software to prevent giving entities supporting
genocide any web traffic.

## BDS?

See the [Palestinian Civil Society Call for BDS](https://www.bdsmovement.net/call)
for more background of this.

### Use of "BDS"

The maintainer(s) of this repository strive to adhere to the
[guidelines set by the BDS National Committee](https://bdsmovement.net/news/statement-affiliation-bds-movement-and-use-bds-acronym)
for use of the “BDS” acronym.

If the BNC feels any part of this project fails to live up to their
guidelines, our hope is that they will contact us, and we will work
towards rectifying this!
